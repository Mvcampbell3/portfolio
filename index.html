      <p>My name is Michael Campbell, and I am a Web Developer. Below, you will be able to see which
        technologies and concepts I use, what projects I have worked on in the past, and on which project(s) I am
        currently working. My motivation is to make compelling and engaging interactions. My goal is to be the best web
        developer and best person that I can be. My secret plan for reaching that goal is hard work and constant
        progress.</p>
